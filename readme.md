# DATATHON: FISHER's TUNAS

## Some data info

* Traffic per segment data API is pretty painless. 
* Apparently lot's of data but should be aggregated depending on our goals. 
* Around 1 and a half year of historical data available (all-around). Something like that anyway. 

## Project ideas (Bring it on)

1. A list of the best walking paths in Leuven
  * Forecasting for next days? 
  * Building a cost function
  * Genetic algo (or other heuristic for path selection)
  * Uses GPS segment data along with traffic, PM and weather data
  * We could subset selection based on amounts of KMs, time of day etc. 
  * (Pedestrian + Bike)/Car ratio could a useful variable
